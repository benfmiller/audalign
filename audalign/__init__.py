"""
This file serves as the host file for all audalign functions.

recognitions and alignments use recognizer objects which can be configured with
their respective configuration objects.

There are a number of functions that can be used to enhance the alignments such
as "uniform leveling" and "remove noise" functions. Writing shifts can also be nifty.

One useful workflow could be to uniform level some files, do a remove noise on them, then
align and fine align them. Then, to have the shifts applied to the original files, use
"write_shifts_from_results".
